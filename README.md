# Random-Buttons.io
This was just a try of making a framework which represents the various buttons and so that one can use them in there project. The use is simple include the css file of it in your project and add class name. The buttons would appear.

Example Use
Here is the example to use facebook button : <button class="btn make mb5"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> Facebook </button>
**Just Click the button and the class would be copied

mb5 represents color code,make is button configuration
